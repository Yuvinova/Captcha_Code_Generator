# Captcha_Code_Generator

Objective: Develop a Python program that generates Audio and Image CAPTCHAs with additional features such as an "I am not a robot" button and a timer functionality for managing maximum attempts.


Features:
1) Audio CAPTCHA: Random audio CAPTCHAs are generated, challenging users to decipher spoken characters or words to prove their human identity.
 
2) Image CAPTCHA: Random image CAPTCHAs are generated, requiring users to recognize and enter the characters or objects depicted in the images.
 
3) "I am not a robot" Button: A user-friendly interface includes a checkbox to affirm the user's human status and prevent automated bot interactions.
 
4) Timer Feature: When the user exceeds the maximum number of attempts, a timer is activated, displaying a countdown to enhance security and discourage brute-force attacks.


Python Libraries Used :
1) Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI).

2) Image Captcha: Image Captcha is a technique used to verify that a user is human by presenting an image containing distorted or obscured characters or objects

3) PILLOW: PILLOW is a Python library that adds image processing capabilities to Python. It provides a wide range of functions and methods for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats. 

4) OS: The OS module is a built-in Python module that provides a way to interact with the operating system.

5) pyttsx3: pyttsx3 is a Python library for text-to-speech conversion. It allows us to convert text into speech, providing an auditory output for the generated audio CAPTCHAs.

In conclusion, our mini project successfully demonstrates the generation of audio and image CAPTCHAs in Python, along with the "I am not a robot" button and a timer functionality.

These features contribute to strengthening the security of online platforms by differentiating humans from automated bots. 
Moving forward, we see further improvements, such as implementing machine learning algorithms to enhance CAPTCHA recognition and exploring additional validation mechanisms.
